# map_viewer/mappings_and_rules.yaml
# Configuration for device-to-unit mapping and signal-based color rules

default_color: "#D3D3D3"  # Light gray - default/neutral state

# Device ID to UnitID mapping
# Maps device_id patterns (with wildcards) to UnitId values from the XML
device_to_unit:
  # Conveyor belts
  - pattern: "B1ACNV*@*"
    unit_id: "*"  # Use the prefix before @ as unit_id
  # Diverters

# Color rules based on signal values
# Each rule specifies: signal name, operator, value, resulting color, and priority
# Higher priority rules are evaluated first
#
# New text overlay feature:
#   - text: single character to display (e.g., 'X' to cross out)
#   - text_color: color for the text overlay
#   - bg_color: background color (if not specified, uses 'color')
